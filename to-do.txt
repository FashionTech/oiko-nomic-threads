Oiko-nomic Threads 
installation for algorithmically controlled knitting machine and open data 
(c) Athens 2013 Marinos Koutsomichalis, Maria Varela, Afroditi Psara


HARDWARE 
- install encoders/sensors
- re-design/install PCB
- work-out a solution with the stepper in order to automate the K-carriage movement


ARDUINO
- encode on line of data to the proper solenoid instructions according to the position of the K-carriage so that it is possible to knit an actual line of data 
- develop some kind of API and set-up serial communication 


Oiko-Threads App
- clean up and optimize code
- fix a bug on pattern encoding 
- develop a class that will take care of sending the appropriate data to the arduino for knitting
- design a class that would synchronize everything (data-retreival, encoding, sending over serial, knitting, waiting, etc)
- update the Pattern::distribute function and the data.h/cpp so that the distribution is based on some sort of meta-data rather than random-numbers
